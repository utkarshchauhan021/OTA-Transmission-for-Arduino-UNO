# OTA-Transmission-for-Arduino-UNO
**What is Over the Air (OTA) Transmission?**
OTA (Over the Air) update is the process of uploading firmware to an Micro controlling module using a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connection rather than a serial port. Such functionality becomes extremely useful in case of limited or no physical access to the module.

**Components Required:**
1)Arduino UNO R3
2)Bluetooth HC-05 module
3)Breadboard
4)Connecting wires
5)Resistance
6)Capacitors

**Circuit Diagram:**
Can be found above.

**Putting the Bluetooth Module into Command Mode:**
While connecting Bluetooth module to the breadboard, the reset button is to be pressed. After two seconds, hold the key button down until the Bluetooth module LED begins blinking at a 2-second interval.

**Code:**
Can be found above

Connect HC-05 to PC:
The password to connect the HC-05 module to PC is either 1234 or 0000.

Disconnect from PC:
A battery or power bank can now be used to power the circuit. This USB cable will be used to connect it to the power bank. You should be aware that there is no connection between the board and the computer at any time.

NOW THE OVER THE AIR TRANSMISSION IS READY TO WORK, ONE CAN UPLOAD ANY KIND OF SKETCH BY CONNECNTION TO THE RIGHT COM.
